# Open Banking Developer Portal

## Open Banking

The Zenith Bank(UK) Open Banking API is based on the Open Banking Standard which allows regulated Third Party Providers (TPPs) to access Account Information Services (AIS) for member accounts.

Access to these services on behalf of members is controlled by strong customer authentication within Zenith Bank(UK) apps as part of OpenID Connect authorisation flows.

We are a registered Account Servicing Payment Service Provider (ASPSP) who provide access to these services based on the Open Banking standard.
