## Fall back channel
Zenith Bank’s MCI acts as a fall back channel in the event that open banking api’s are unavailable. The MCI enables a Third Party Provider (TPP) to access any of Zenith Bank’s Payment Service User (PSU) payment accounts via a browser based access channel.

Under PSR2017 regulation, Zenith Bank’s MCI requires a Qualified Web Authentication Certificate (QWAC) which will be validated by Zenith Bank as part of the connection establishment process.Upon successful connection and validation of the certificate, a TPP will then be required to get the PSU to authenticate (using their online banking credentials) in order to gain access to requested services.

- https://zenith.mci.uk-hub-prod.ozoneapi.co.uk *

_*This endpoint is only available to TPPs with a valid QWAC._
